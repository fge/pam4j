Release Notes For jpam version 0.4
=====================================

Introduction
============
Jpam is a Java-PAM bridge.  PAM, or Pluggable Authentication Modules, is a standard security architecture used
on Unix, Linux and Mac OS X systems.

JPAM permits the use of PAM authentication services to Java applications running on those platforms.
These services include:

account, auth, password, session

JAAS
====
Jpam comes with a JAAS implementation. See JpamLoginModule.

Limitations
===========
Jpam does not support advanced PAM conversations such as:
 - change password on first login
 - change password as expired

Java Requirements
=================
Jpam supports JDK1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 at runtime.

Jpam does not work with JDK1.1. JNI used a different interface prior to JDK1.2.

IBM 1.4.2.0 JVM works but has native libraries in a different place.

Add -native.java.library.path=/usr/lib/jvm/java-ibm/jre/bin (or wherever the IBM JVM is installed )
to your Java command line.

Java Dependencies
=================

Apache Commons Logging is required for logging.

Operating Systems
=================

Jpam supports:

1. Linux x86
2. Linux x86_64, including AMD64
3. Mac OS X
4. Solaris


Thread Safety
=============
Authenticate methods in JPam are threadsafe, even though PAM is not.

Installing Additional PAM Modules
=================================
JPam will dynamically link to any Pam module in its configuration. No recompilation
is required.

Documentation
=============
See http://jpam.sourceforge.net/documentation for full documentation.

The JavaDoc is in the distribution and also online at
http://jpam.sourceforge.net/javadoc.

Configuration
=============
The distribution contains an example pam.d configuration file
called net-sf-jpam.

To configure jpam, edit net-sf-jpam and copy it to /etc/pam.d. Follow the instructions in that
file for the PAM module you configure.

See http://jpam.sourceforge.net/documentation/#configuration for more information.

Building JPam
=============

To build JPam from sources:

1. As root, install the pam-devel-0.77-66.2 package or similar is installed (Linux systems only)
2. Create the following users on your machine:
     user test password test01
     user test2 password test02
3. As root, copy src/config/<architecture>/net-sf-jpam* to /etc/pam.d
4. Copy src/config/<architecture>/.java.login.config to your home directory
5. Ensure you have a valid JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME configured with binaries in your PATH
6. From witing the pam directory, type ant


Debugging
=========

DEBUG
-----
If the DEBUG logging level is enabled, jpam will show logging from Java. libjpam.so will
log messages to the console.

syslogd
-------
It is useful to turn on syslogd for PAM logging. Library problems with PAM modules will then
be logged.

Add "auth.notice" to the /var/log/messages line in /etc/syslog.conf.

e.g.

*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none;auth.notice    /var/log/messages
