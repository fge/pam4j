/**
 * Performs tests on the Pam class using the DigiPass service. Digipass uses the PAM Radius module.
 * <p/>
 * Before running you need to do some configuration:
 * <p/>
 * 1. Copy the net-sf-jpam-digipass config file to /etc/pam.d. You need to be root to do this.
 * 2. Create a user called test in the DigiPass server
 * 3. Have a DigiPass token set up on the DigiPass server.
 * 5. Verify that the all is working using the Radius test tool radtest.
 * 6. Verify that the pam_securid.so PAM module is working. Change a service like login to use it and test it.
 * 7. Make sure the user has permission to all of the files in /opt/pam and /lib/security/
