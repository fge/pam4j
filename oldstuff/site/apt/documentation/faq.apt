Frequently Asked Questions

* Does JPam run on {JDK1.2}?

 No, it is not supported.

* JPam does not have a configuration for my OS/architecture. What can I do?

 It is easy to make the changes to the build.xml and makefile to support other
 architectures. Do it and submit a patch! Both Solaris and HP-UX support come from patches.
