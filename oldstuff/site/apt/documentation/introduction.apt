Introduction

    JPam is a Java-PAM bridge.  PAM, or Pluggable Authentication Modules, is a standard security architecture used on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and other Unix systems.
    JPam is the missing link between the two.

    JPAM permits the use of PAM authentication facilities by Java applications running on those platforms.
    These facilities include:

    * account

    * auth

    * password

    * session
