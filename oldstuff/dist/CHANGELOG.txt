jpam-1.1
========

<release version="1.1" date="2007-06-8" desc="1.1 maintenance release">

            <action dev="Greg Luck" issue="1381572" type="update">
                JVM crash when the user account is expired.
                This issue was produced by the fact that the conversational function
                "pam_conv" from Pam.c was not aware of message style. In fact, if
                PAM_ERROR_MSG or other was sent, a free() on an invalid pointer would be
                produced, leading to Java threads going nuts and therefore the Java
                program hanging or 'segfaulting'.
                See also https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=219916

                This issue has been reopened.

            <action dev="Greg Luck" type="fix" issue="1707044">
                The fix for 1381572 seems to make JPAM crash immediately on lots of systems.
                Fix this issue by reverting 1381572. A new fix to 1381572 will be put out
                as a beta. In the meantime a release note around not allowing passwords to expire
                when using JPAM will be created.

            Rather than coding for the different types of password prompts, we now check for the PAM_PROMPT. This
            should make JPam deal with many more situations without modification.

</release>


jpam-0.5
========
- Tests now pass on Novell Linux Desktop 9. Change the passwd line in /etc/nsswitch.conf to "passwd: files compat"
from "passwd: compat" 
- Applied a patch from Ken Huffman. JPam service names are now configurable in the JAAS configuration files, if you
using JAAS. If using the Pam class directly, you as always add the serviceName as an argument.
- Added support for Solaris Sparc thanks to Seth Theriault.

jpam-0.4
========
- Removed dependency on selinux on Linux systems.
- Added support for dynamic linking to shared libraries. The makefile is now very simple. Additional PAM modules
can be used at runtime simply by changing config files. No need to link them in.
- Concurrency test now passes with 0 errors. JPam's authenticate method is now threadsafe even though PAM is not.
- Changed SourceForge status to beta.
- Testing and improvements by David Lutterkort of RedHat.
