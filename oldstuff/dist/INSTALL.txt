Installation
============

Follow the instructions for your architecture.

Linux x86
=========

1. Place jpam.jar in your classpath.

2. Place libjpam.so in the java.library.path.

    e.g. Copy libjpam.so to the ${java.home}/lib/i386/client directory.

3. Configure JAAS by copying .java.login.config to the home directory.

4. Copy the net-sf-jpam PAM configuration to /etc/pam.d and alter it to suit your needs.

If you need to use a PAM module not linked in, obtain the source distribution of JPAM and
build from source. You will need to add the module to the makefile and also configure net-sf-jpam
to use it.

Linux x86_64
============

1. Place jpam.jar in your classpath.

2. Place libjpam.so in the java.library.path.

    e.g. Copy libjpam.so to the ${java.home}/lib/amd64/server.

3. Configure JAAS by copying .java.login.config to the home directory.

4. Copy the net-sf-jpam PAM configuration to /etc/pam.d and alter it to suit your needs.

If you need to use a PAM module not linked in, obtain the source distribution of JPAM and
build from source. You will need to add the module to /lib64/security, add a line to the makefile and also
configure net-sf-jpam to use it.


Mac OS X ppc
============

1. Place jpam.jar in your classpath.

2. Place libjpam.jnilib in the java.library.path.

    e.g. Copy libjpam.jnilib to Library/Java/Extensions/ in the home directory.

3. Configure JAAS by copying .java.login.config to the home directory.

4. Copy the net-sf-jpam PAM configuration to /etc/pam.d and alter it to suit your needs.
