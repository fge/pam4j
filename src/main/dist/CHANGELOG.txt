jpam-0.5
========
- Tests now pass on Novell Linux Desktop 9. Change the passwd line in /etc/nsswitch.conf to "passwd: files compat"
from "passwd: compat" 
- Applied a patch from Ken Huffman. JPam service names are now configurable in the JAAS configuration files, if you
using JAAS. If using the Pam class directly, you as always add the serviceName as an argument.
- Added support for Solaris Sparc thanks to Seth Theriault.

jpam-0.4
========
- Removed dependency on selinux on Linux systems.
